---

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
node >= 18.0.0
mongodb >= 5.0
npm >= 9.0.0
```

### Installation

**1. Clone & Install**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/votechain.git
cd votechain

# Install contract dependencies
npm install

# Backend
cd backend
npm install

# Frontend
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

**2. Deploy Smart Contract**
```bash
# Configure hardhat.config.ts with your keys
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network polygon_mumbai

# Copy contract address to .env
```

**3. Configure Environment**

**Backend (.env)**
```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/votechain
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x...
BLOCKCHAIN_RPC_URL=https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com
ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
JWT_SECRET=your_secret
PORT=3000
```

**Frontend (.env)**
```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x...
REACT_APP_CHAIN_ID=80001
```

**4. Run Services**
```bash
# Terminal 1: MongoDB
mongod

# Terminal 2: Backend
cd backend
npm run dev

# Terminal 3: Frontend
cd frontend
npm start
```

##  How It Works

### Voter Registration
1. User connects wallet (MetaMask)
2. Submits identity verification documents
3. Admin reviews and approves
4. Smart contract registers voter's wallet address
5. Voter can now participate in elections

### Creating an Election
```solidity
// Admin creates election on blockchain
createElection(
  "2025 Mayor Election",
  "Vote for next mayor",
  startTime,
  endTime,
  ElectionType.SingleChoice,
  ["Candidate A", "Candidate B"],
  ["Description A", "Description B"]
)
```

### Casting a Vote
1. Voter browses active elections
2. Selects candidate
3. Confirms choice in modal
4. Transaction sent to blockchain
5. Smart contract records vote
6. Vote hash generated for verification
7. Voter receives confirmation

### Vote Verification
```solidity
// Voter can verify their vote was recorded
verifyVote(
  electionId,
  candidateIndex,
  secretKey,
  timestamp
) returns (bool)
```

Returns `true` if vote matches, without revealing which candidate

### Results Publication
```solidity
// After election ends
endElection(electionId)
publishResults(electionId)

// Results now visible to everyone
getResults(electionId)
```

---

##  Security Features

### Cryptographic Security
```javascript
// Each vote generates unique hash
voteHash = keccak256(
  electionId,
  candidateIndex,
  voterAddress,
  secretKey,
  timestamp
)
```

### Anti-Fraud Measures
- **One vote per address** - Smart contract enforces
- **Time-bound voting** - Only during election period
- **Immutable records** - Cannot alter blockchain data
- **Public verification** - Anyone can audit vote counts

### Privacy Protection
- Voter choices NOT stored with identity
- Only vote hash recorded
- Results show totals, not individual votes
- Zero-knowledge verification possible

---

##  User Flows

1. **Register** → Submit verification documents
2. **Discover** → Browse active elections
3. **Research** → Read candidate information
4. **Vote** → Cast ballot securely
5. **Verify** → Confirm vote was recorded
6. **Results** → View election outcomes

### Admin Journey
1. **Create Election** → Define parameters
2. **Add Candidates** → Upload profiles
3. **Activate** → Deploy to blockchain
4. **Monitor** → Watch turnout in real-time
5. **End** → Close voting period
6. **Publish** → Make results public
